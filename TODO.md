- [ ] mip maps
- [ ] store all shader constants inside immutable cbuffers
- [ ] bind_group: a class with an array of one-type bindables inside to bind them per one call (shader_textures, render_textures, samplers, viewports, cbuffers, dynamic_cbuffers)
- [ ] entity:
	- [x] metadata:
		- [x] create metadata component and store all general entity-related information in it (name?, masks, etc?)
	- [x] masking:
		- [x] add the ability to bit-mask drawable geometry (viewport, shadows, reflections, lighting? etc), 32 bits would probably be enough
- [ ] material:
	- [x] need to rework the way materials are handled by the render queue
- [x] systems:
	- [x] there is no need to store a pointer to a scene registry, just pass it as a function argument
- [ ] hierarchy:
	- [ ] implement it
- [ ] input:
	- [ ] keyboard:
		- [x] probably, there is no need of break-codes, input api generates make-codes even when specified flag is RI_KEY_BREAK
- [ ] mesh:
	- [ ] create mesh primitives and write geometry data in constructor directly without messing with files
		- [x] cube
		- [ ] sphere
- [ ] dcb:
	- [ ] implement const_layout_elem_ref
	- [ ] implement Array functionality
- [ ] warnings
